# MongoDB Driver Compatibility Checker

A comprehensive static web application that helps developers determine if a specific MongoDB driver version is compatible with a given MongoDB server version. It uses MongoDB's [official support lifecycle policy](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles), which mandates drivers support server versions up to **3 years beyond EOL**.

## üîÑ Updating Driver Data

## üîÑ Updating Driver Data (Legacy/Manual)

> **Note**: Driver data is now automatically updated via GitHub Actions. Manual updates are only needed for custom modifications or troubleshooting.

Driver version data is sourced from official MongoDB GitHub repositories. To update manually:

1. **Automated Updates** (Recommended): Use the GitHub Actions workflows described above

2. **Manual API Fetching**: The data can be refreshed by fetching from GitHub APIs:
   - `https://api.github.com/repos/mongodb/mongo-<driver>-driver/releases`

3. **Manual File Updates**: Edit the JSON files in the `data/` directory following the format shown above

4. **Adding New Drivers**:
   - Create a new JSON file in `data/` with driver version information
   - Add the driver to the GitHub Actions matrix in workflow files
   - Update the driver selection dropdown in the HTML file
   - Add appropriate styling and logos if desired
